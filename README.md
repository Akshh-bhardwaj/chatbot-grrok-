🧠 Chatbot using Grok-style Logic (C Language)
This project is a basic chatbot implemented in C that mimics early natural language response systems. It is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how structured condition-based logic can simulate conversational AI.

🔧 Features
Console-based chatbot interface

Predefined responses to common questions

Simple keyword matching logic

Customizable dataset of responses

User input handling using string functions
